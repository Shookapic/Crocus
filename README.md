## Epitech Duo Stumper NÂ°3 - Crocus

For this project you need to make numbers **(0 to 9)** in ASCII Art. :art:

The ASCII Art should be made of a character based on this operation :
(Index of the number % (modulo) (len of the string))

For example if the first string is "astek" and the second is "0345" the program will do :

(0 % (len(astek)) which equal to 'a', then (3 % (len(astek))) which equal to 'e', etc...

The program should be launch like this : **./crocus -s "astek" -n "0345"** or **./crocus -n "0345" -s "astek"**

**You should get this kind of output :**

I would like to thanks my teammate [MAILLOT Nathan](https://github.com/MAILLOTNathan) who did this Stumper with me. :fire:
